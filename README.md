hall effect example
===================

playing around with a [US5881 hall effect sensor](http://melexis.com/Position--Speed-Sensors/Hall-Effect-Unipolar-Switches-/US5881-148.aspx) on an atmega328p

works as follows:

- hook up hall effect sensor output to PB0 on the atmega
- hook an LED up to PB1
- move a magnet close to the hall effect sensor and [marvel at the LED turning on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFz0uchLJYA)
